YAML.VIM and YAML collection sorting scripts:

INSTALLATION:
- Put yaml.vim in vim's syntax folder (/usr/share/vim/syntax on my system)
- Add the .yaml/.yml extensions to the filetype.vim file: |
    " Yaml
    au BufNewFile,BufRead *.yaml,*.yml    setf yaml
- If you want add a new enty to the syntax menu:
    an 50.110.370 &Syntax.WXYZ.Yaml :cal SetSyn("yaml")<CR>
- Put yamlsort.rb and yamlsort.vim into ~/.vim/scripts directory.

SORT USE:
- Type vim command: |
    :source ~/.vim/scripts/yamlsort.vim
- Then: >
    <F4> is mapped to sort YAML collections in direct order, 
    and <F5> in reversed order.

NOTES:
- If you want change key mapping of sorting rules edit yamlsort.vim

TODO:
- Work with short notation of collections and mappings ({}, [])
- Support sorting of multiline values

Changelog:

    If any record of collection does not key field (i.e field which
    value is used in sorting), it is placed to the end of collection.
